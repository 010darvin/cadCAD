    "\n",
    "We explored here two different paradigms for modelling: the dynamic system one, which captures an macroscopical view of the system, and the agent-based one, which uses an microscopic view for the system. Depending on the targets and considerations, both can be equivalent or completely distinct, but can be also complementary. cadCAD allows you to mix them at will, so you can have hybrid models where agent behaviour and environment are shaped by complex dynamical systems. There is an whole multiverse of mixed simulations that you can do (challenges on next block for you to try!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, both paradigms have some characteristics, which in general manner we can express as being:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dynamical system (macroscopic view) advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fast-performing, allowing an very large number of timesteps and simulations\n",
    "* Easier to prototype and to add/modify mechanisms\n",
    "* Easier to insert a multitude of complex factors\n",
    "* The output is usually easy to visualize\n",
    "* Inner workings are more transparent\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Agent-based modelling (microscopic view) advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Are conceptually closer to experience, making easier to explain\n",
    "* There is more allowance on stochastic mechanisms and logic\n",
    "* Easier to generate complex behaviour with simple rules\n",
    "* Generates more granular and detailed information\n",
    "* Inner workings have more depth\n"

    "### Proposed challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sazonability of food growth\n",
    "\n",
    "An quick way to mix the ABM and SD paradigms is by the following: what if the food growth depends on an dynamical system? \n",
    "\n",
    "You can model that by modifying the food growth policy, like by inserting an sazonability which depends on the timestep for example. Or you could go even further and try to express it as depending on an irradiance-based dynamical system which models the Sun position according to Earth's movements (rotation, translation, recession and nutation). How much do you think that those layers of additional complexity will add to knowledge behind the physical system which we are modelling?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stochasticity of the agents decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "When the agents takes its actions (move, reproduce and eat), there is an randomness about where they'll do it, but not about if they actually decide to do it. What if the decision was random instead of always doing it? What if this decision depends on an given probability distribution? And what if the decision was shaped by the nearby enviroment, like predator presence and food availability nearby?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Agent death by exponential probability\n",
    "\n",
    "All agents die when the maximum lifespan arrives. Can you modify the ABM for having an associated spontaneous death probability according to exponential distribution? Something which makes almost all young agents live, but most old ones to die? What if this probability is shaped somehow to the agent health, like the fullness/emptiness of his stomach?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prey evolution & adaptation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the master challenge.  What if the preys had individually variable attributes which could bring them competitive advantages? Like movement speed, reproduction rate, or different lifespans? What if those attributes were mutated and passed on their offspring?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the Darwinian version of the P&P ABM. **Are you the fittest of the cadCAD modellers?**"
