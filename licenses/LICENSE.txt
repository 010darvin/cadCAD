prior agreements or understandings between the parties as to its subject matter. It may be amended or modified, or

EXHIBIT A

SOFTWARE

Software Name: SimCAD tool

Software Description: SimCAD is a Monte-Carlo based simulation software package for research, validation, and
Computer Aided Design of economic systems. An economic system is treated as a state based model and defined
through a set of endogenous and exogenous state variables which are updated through mechanisms and
environmental processes, respectively. Behavioral models, which may be deterministic or stochastic, provide the
evolution of the system within the action space of the mechanisms. Simulations can be run with a range of initial
conditions and parameters for states, behaviors, mechanisms, and environmental processes to understand and
visualize network behavior under various conditions.
